       dnf - DNF Command Reference

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mdnf [options] <command> [<args>...][0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mDNF[24m  is  the  next upcoming major version of [4mYum[24m, a package manager for
       RPM-based Linux distributions. It roughly maintains  CLI  compatibility
       with Yum and defines a strict API for extensions and plugins.

       Plugins  can modify or extend features of DNF or provide additional CLI
       commands on top of those mentioned below. If you know the name of  such
       a  command  (including  commands mentioned below), you may find/install
       the package which provides it using the appropriate virtual provide  in
       the form of [1mdnf-command(<alias>)[22m, where [1m<alias> [22mis the name of the com‐
       mand; e.g.``dnf install 'dnf-command(versionlock)'``  installs  a  [1mver‐[0m
       [1msionlock  [22mplugin. This approach also applies to specifying dependencies
       of packages that require a particular DNF command.

       Return values:

       · [1m0  [22m: Operation was successful.

       · [1m1  [22m: An error occurred, which was handled by dnf.

       · [1m3  [22m: An unknown unhandled error occurred during operation.

              ically  during  [4mdnf[24m [4mupgrade[24m, which by default skips over updates
              that can not be installed for  dependency  reasons,  the  switch
              forces  DNF  to  only consider the latest packages. When running
              into packages with broken dependencies, DNF will fail  giving  a
              reason why the latest version can not be installed.

       [1m--bugfix[0m
              Includes  packages  that  fix  a  bugfix  issue.  Applicable for

              Run  entirely  from system cache, don't update the cache and use
              it even in case it is expired.

              DNF uses a separate cache for each user under which it executes.
              The  cache  for  the  root user is called the system cache. This
              switch allows a regular user  read-only  access  to  the  system
              cache  which  usually  is more fresh than the user's and thus he
              does not have to wait for metadata sync.

          Checks the local packagedb and produces information on any  problems
          it  finds.  You  can pass the check command the options "--dependen‐
          cies", "--duplicates", "--obsoleted" or "--provides", to  limit  the
          checking that is performed (the default is "all" which does all).

   [1mCheck Update Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] check-update [<package-specs>...][0m
          Non-interactively  checks  if  updates of the specified packages are
          available. If no  [1m<package-specs>  [22mare  given,  checks  whether  any
          updates  at all are available for your system. DNF exit code will be
          100 when there are updates available and a list of the updates  will
          be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs.

          Please  note  that  having a specific newer version available for an
          installed package (and reported by [1mcheck-update[22m) does not imply that
          subsequent  [1mdnf  upgrade [22mwill install it. The difference is that [1mdnf[0m
          [1mupgrade [22mmust also ensure the satisfiability of all dependencies  and
          other restrictions.

   [1mClean Command[0m
       Performs  cleanup  of  temporary  files  kept  for  repositories.  This
       includes any such data left behind from disabled or  removed  reposito‐
       ries as well as for different distribution release versions.

       [1mdnf clean dbcache[0m
              Removes cache files generated from the repository metadata. This
              forces DNF to regenerate the cache files the  next  time  it  is
              run.

       [1mdnf clean expire-cache[0m
              Marks  the repository metadata expired. DNF will re-validate the
              cache for each repo the next time it is used.

       [1mdnf clean metadata[0m
              Removes repository metadata. Those are the files which DNF  uses
              to  determine  the  remote  availability of packages. Using this
              option will make DNF download all the metadata the next time  it
              is run.

              [1m--with-optional [22mis specified. All [4mmandatory[24m and [4mDefault[24m packages
              will  be  installed whenever possible.  Conditional packages are
              installed if they meet their requirement.  If group  is  already
              (partially)  installed,  command  installs missing packages from
              the group.

              Mark the group removed and remove those packages  in  the  group
              from  the  system which are neither comprising another installed
              group and were not installed explicitly by the user.

       [1mdnf [options] group upgrade <group-spec>...[0m
              Upgrades the packages from the  group  and  upgrades  the  group
              itself.  The  latter  comprises of installing pacakges that were
              added to the group by the  distribution  and  removing  packages
              that  got  removed  from  the  group  as  far  as  they were not
              installed explicitly by the user.

       Groups can also be  marked  installed  or  removed  without  physically
       manipulating any packages:

       [1mdnf [options] group mark install <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark   the  specified  group  installed.  No  packages  will  be
              installed by this command  but  the  group  is  then  considered
              installed.

       [1mdnf [options] group mark remove <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark the specified group removed. No packages will be removed by

              Finds the packages providing the given [1m<provide-spec>[22m.  This  is
              useful  when one knows a filename and wants to find what package
              (installed or not) provides this file.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata.  See

[1mSPECIFYING PACKAGES[0m
       Many  commands  take  a [1m<package-spec> [22mparameter that selects a package
       for the operation. DNF looks for interpretations of the parameter  from
       the  most  commonly used meanings to the least, that is it tries to see
       if the given spec fits one of the  following  patterns  (in  decreasing
       order of priority):

       · [1mname.arch[0m

       · [1mname[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version-release.arch[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version-release[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version[0m

       Note that [1mname [22mcan in general contain dashes (e.g. [1mpackage-subpackage[22m).

       Failing  to  match the input argument to an existing package name based
       on the patterns above, DNF tries to see  if  the  argument  matches  an
       existing provide.

       By  default,  if multiple versions of the selected package exist in the
       repo, the most recent version suitable for the given operation is used.
       If the selected package exists for multiple architectures, the packages
       which best match the system's architecture will be preferred. The  name
       specification  is  case-sensitive,  globbing characters "[1m?[22m, [1m* [22mand [1m[ [22mare
       allowed and trigger shell-like glob matching. If globbing character  is
       present  in [1mname[22m, DNF expands given [1mname [22mfirst and consequently selects
       all packages matching expanded [1m<package-spec>[22m.

       [1m<package-name-spec> [22mis similar to [1m<package-spec>  [22mexcept  the  provides
       matching is never attempted there.

       [1m<package-installed-specs>  [22mis similar to [1m<package-specs> [22mexcept it con‐
       siders only installed packages.

[1mSPECIFYING EXACT VERSIONS OF PACKAGES[0m
       Commands accepting the [1m<package-nevr-spec> [22mparameter need not only  the
       name  of  the package, but also its version, release and optionally the
       architecture. Further, the version part can be  preceded  by  an  epoch
       when it is relevant (i.e. the epoch is non-zero).

[1mSPECIFYING PROVIDES[0m
       [1m<provide-spec>  [22min  command  descriptions means the command operates on
       packages providing the given spec. This can either be an explicit  pro‐
       vide, an implicit provide (i.e. name of the package) or a file provide.
       The selection is case-sensitive and globbing is supported.

[1mSPECIFYING GROUPS[0m
       [1m<group-spec> [22mallows one to select  (environment)  groups  a  particular
       operation  should  work on. It is a case insensitive string (supporting
       globbing characters) that is matched against a  group's  ID,  canonical
       name and name translated into the current LC_MESSAGES locale (if possi‐
       ble).

[1mSPECIFYING TRANSACTIONS[0m
       [1m<transaction-spec> [22mcan be in one of several forms. If it is an integer,
       it  specifies a transaction ID. Specifying [1mlast [22mis the same as specify‐
       ing the ID of the most recent transaction. The last form is  [1mlast-<off‐[0m
       [1mset>[22m,  where  [1m<offset>  [22mis  a  positive integer. It specifies offset-th
       transaction preceding the most recent transaction.

[1mMETADATA SYNCHRONIZATION[0m
       Correct operation of DNF depends on having access  to  up-to-date  data
       from  all  enabled  repositories but contacting remote mirrors on every
       operation considerably slows it down and costs bandwidth for  both  the
       client   and   the   repository   provider.  The  metadata_expire  (see
       [1mdnf.conf(5)[22m) repo config option is used by  DNF  to  determine  whether
       particular  local copy of repository data is due to be re-synced. It is
       crucial that the repository providers set the option well, namely to  a
       value  where it is guaranteed that if particular metadata was available
       in time [1mT [22mon the server, then all packages it references will still  be
       available for download from the server in time [1mT + metadata_expire[22m.

       To further reduce the bandwidth load, some of the commands where having
       up-to-date metadata is not critical (e.g. the [1mlist [22mcommand) do not look
       at  whether  a  repository is expired and whenever any version of it is
       locally available, it will be used. Note that  in  all  situations  the
       user  can  force  synchronization  of all enabled repositories with the
       [1m--refresh [22mswitch.

[1mCONFIGURATION FILES REPLACEMENT POLICY[0m
       The updated packages could replace the old modified configuration files
       with  the  new  ones  or keep the older files. Neither of the files are
       actually replaced.  To the conflicting ones RPM gives additional suffix
       to  the  origin  name.  Which  file should maintain the true name after
       transaction is not controlled by package manager but  is  specified  by
       each package itself, following packaging guideline.
