## Built-In Shortcodes

### Netlify Contact Form

A contact form working with the built-in Netlify form handling service is inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< contact >}}
```

A custom success page URL may be given as a parameter:

```
{{< contact "success/" >}}
```

### On-Click Soundcloud Player

An on-click Soundcloud Player is inserted with the shortcode:

```
{{< soundcloud 123456789 >}}
```

The parameter is a track ID and can be extracted from the "embed" sharing menu on the track webpage.


## Dynamically embedded CSS and JS

To embed additional CSS and JS with custom shortcodes, they must be loaded as resources by Hugo and added to the page-wide `.Scratch` variable. As a result, they will be loaded in pages where the shortcodes are used.

For instance, from within a shortcode template:

```html
{{ resources.Get "myscript.js" | fingerprint | slice | .Page.Scratch.Add "js" }}
```

As an example here is the shortcode template for the on-click Soundcloud player:

```html
{{ resources.Get "css/soundcloud.css" | minify | fingerprint | slice | .Page.Scratch.Add "css" }}
{{ resources.Get "js/soundcloud.js" | minify | fingerprint | slice | .Page.Scratch.Add "js" }}
<div class="Soundcloud" data-id="{{ .Get 0 }}"></div>
```
